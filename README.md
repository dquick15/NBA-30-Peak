# NBA-30-Peak

I was inspired to do this project simply because the players I grew up watching are getting closer to the end of their careers. 
Understanding productivity and prime windows is important in the business of athletics. I wanted to see if there was concrete evidence to support these takes that the window of
some of our favorite basketball players is closing. In a league that has been heavily focused on offensive production, the best way for me to understand a potential drop-off
would be to look at meaures such as free throw attempts, field goal percentage and points per game.
